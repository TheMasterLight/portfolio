This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

# Personal Portfolio

This is an effort to create a digital portfolio. I hope to expand this with additional pages as I develop more code projects and find a way to translate some of what I write over to a specfic writing section. 

## Digital Business Card

Currently the attempt to build out a portfolio needed a minor about me page and digital business card. Taking care of both at the same time, the about section has a little information about myself while the top portion has contact information as well as a link to contact me via email.
