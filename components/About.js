      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>A writer for most of my life, I love to tell stores.</p>
      <p>In my resume of writing credentials, I have done some ghostwriting for a local newspaper as well as several unpublished manuscripts featuring different media from comic books to screenplays and novels.</p>
      <p>I was born in Salt Lake City and have lived there most of my life. I spent two years serving an LDS mission in Taiwan, where I learned to speak Chinese and was able to appreciate the unique and interesting culture. Returning home, I spent the majority of my time learning how to write and developing that skill to be able to tell stories. </p>
