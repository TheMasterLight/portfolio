      <h3>TTRPGs</h3>
      <p>I have always loved the idea of Table Top Games, and Role Playing Games have really shown how amazing it is for a group of friends coming together in order to tell a story. The Rules that are established to a TTRPG environment are also a lot of fun allowing people to use the rule system to enhance a story rather than just making things up as you go.</p>
      <h3>Video Games</h3>
      <p>Arguably my most indulged in hobby, I have always been facinated by the storytelling medium of video games. The unique nature of dropping in a protagonist it acts much like the an adventure novel where you get to choose the outcome! The neat thing is that you can also explore interesting mechanics and ways of telling a story that conventional novels and movies are not able to capture.</p>
      <p>Just don&apos;t ask how many hours I have sunk into Destiny 2.</p>
